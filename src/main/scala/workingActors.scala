// CONTEXT
// This program is for teaching an introduction to Actors, workers and Scala programming.
// The Actors work round-robin calculating the sum of an infinite series that converges to pi.
// Each actor is assigned a sequence of terms in the series from left-to-right and a series of calculations within the sequence.
// The work is compute-bound. The algorithm chosen (sum of the Madhava-Gregoryâ€“Leibniz series) is for education.
// Faster methods exist for computing pi, but this slower method is ideal for explaining the Actor concept.
// The goal of the work is to lay a foundation for later demos in pull and stream-oriented cluster computing.
// This demo was designed so students could work easily in a browser against a real backend.
// For further explanation please see the companion training video.

// CLASSES
//
class LogtoChart extends Actor {
  // this Actor keeps track of results for simple logging and charting
}
//
//
class Worker extends Actor {
  // this class of Actors defines the role of a Worker
}
//
//
class Director(numWorkingActors: Int, numSequences: Int, numStepsPerSequence: Int, reporter: ActorRef) extends Actor {
  //  this Actor directs the working actors
}
//
//
class Reporter extends Actor {
  // this Actor reports the final results and shuts down the actor system
}


// START OF APP
//

  // send an explanation of this demo to the console
  // make it readable here as well

  println(" WHY ACTORS MATTER")
  println(" Computing the sum of the series is a compute-bound task that shows Actors as workers, where work is pushed.")
  println(" Understanding it lays a good foundation for rethinking how work might otherwise be allocated, such as pulling or streaming.")
  println(" The Actor model is a key method of concurrent computing, that uses message passing to limit deadlocks or race conditions.")
  println(" Actors can be especially effective in modern cluster computing.")

  println(" WATCH THE LIVE LOGGING")
  println(" Below in the console (when run) will be a log of a each actor's assignment to a sequence.")
  println(" ENTER shows where each actor starts work on an assigned sequence in the series.")
  println(" EXIT shows the result of an actor computing 20,000 steps within a sequence.")
  println()
  //
  // numWorkingActors are the number of Actors that work on the series
  // numSequences is the number of adjacent sequences that will be calculated, from left to right, in the series
  // numStepsPerSequence is the number of steps to compute within a sequence, work all done by a single Worker
  // The number of Work messages will be the same as the number of sequences which, in our demo, will exceed numWorkingActors
  // Each sequence will be assigned one Worker, sent one Work message, and managed round-robin by workerrouter
  // An Actor assigned by workerrouter will, therefore, work more than one sequence
