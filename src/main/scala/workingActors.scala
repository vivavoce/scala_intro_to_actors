// CONTEXT
// This program is for teaching an introduction to Actors, workers and Scala programming.
// The Actors work round-robin calculating the sum of an infinite series that converges to pi.
// Each actor is assigned a sequence of terms in the series from left-to-right and a series of calculations within the sequence.
// The work is compute-bound. The algorithm chosen (sum of the Madhava-Gregoryâ€“Leibniz series) is for education.
// Faster methods exist for computing pi, but this slower method is ideal for explaining the Actor concept.
// The goal of the work is to lay a foundation for later demos in pull and stream-oriented cluster computing.
// This demo was designed so students could work easily in a browser against a real backend.
// For further explanation please see the companion training video.

// IMPORTS
// from external libraries
// scala (the running time), scalac (the compiler) and sbt (the build tool) can find standard libraries
// for other libraries see the companion file build.sbt
